# raft-practice

I have read the [paper](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) to learn about the raft algorithm.  
The purpose of this project is to understand it better by doing a simple implementation of raft.

The state of each server is complex when persistence is considered.   
Therefore, this project is a simple on-memory implementation of the state.
